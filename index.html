        The true story of the giant company Wrigley begins with the
        entrepreneurial spirit of a young man named William Wrigley Jr. Born in
        Philadelphia on September 30, 1861, Wrigley displayed an early aptitude
        for business and an unwavering determination that would eventually lead
        to the creation of one of the most iconic brands in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1891, at the age of 29, Wrigley moved to Chicago and started his own
        soap and baking powder business. To differentiate his products, he began
        offering free chewing gum as an incentive with each purchase.
        Surprisingly, the gum became more popular than the products he was
        selling. Recognizing this, Wrigley shifted his focus entirely to the
        chewing gum market, a decision that would shape his legacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wrigley established the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 1891, laying the
        foundation for what would eventually become a multinational corporation.
        At the outset, the company produced various flavors of chewing gum,
        including Juicy Fruit and Spearmint, both of which would become
        synonymous with the Wrigley brand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The turning point for the company came in 1915 when Wrigley
        revolutionized the industry by introducing a groundbreaking marketing
        strategy. He distributed free samples of chewing gum to every address
        listed in telephone directories across the United States. This bold move
        not only familiarized the public with his products but also solidified
        the Wrigley brand in the consciousness of American consumers.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the success of his marketing endeavors, the Wrigley Company rapidly
        expanded its operations, establishing a global presence and dominating
        the chewing gum market. The company's commitment to innovation and
        high-quality products solidified its reputation as a leader in the
        confectionery industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, Wrigley's commitment to excellence and its relentless
        pursuit of customer satisfaction propelled the company to even greater
        heights. It became a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated in 2008, further
        solidifying its position as a global powerhouse in the confectionery and
        food industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        The legacy of Wrigley endures as a testament to the vision and
        perseverance of William Wrigley Jr. His commitment to providing
        high-quality, affordable products and his innovative marketing
        strategies continue to inspire businesses and entrepreneurs worldwide.
        The Wrigley Company remains a shining example of how a simple idea,
        driven by passion and perseverance, can evolve into a global empire.
